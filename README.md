# LAB03-WordGuessGame
This is a .NET Core 2.1 Console Application written in C# in order to familarize using the System.IO class library. Within the console, users can input data into a text file. They can also read from the text file, update it, and delete it entirely. 

The main idea of the game is she must guess what a mystery word is by inputting (1) letter at a time. The game should save all of her guesses (both correct and incorrect) throughout each session of the game, along with the ability to show her how many letters out of the word she has guessed correctly.

Each time a new game session starts, the mystery word chosen should come from an external text file that randomly selects one of the words listed. This bank of words should be editable by Josie so that she may view, add, and delete words as she wishes. She expects the game to have a simple user interface that is easy to navigate.

Users may play a word guessing game similar to hangman.
